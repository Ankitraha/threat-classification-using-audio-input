# Threat Classification Model

## Overview

The Threat Classification Model is a machine learning system designed to analyze and classify audio inputs to identify potential threats. This model utilizes advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques to provide accurate and efficient threat detection capabilities.

## Features

- Text extraction from Audio
- Threat classification(Toxic,Normal,Obscene,Threat,Identity_hate,....and many more) from the given text.

## Usage

- Open the jupyter file and run the cells and jupyter will download the libraries.
